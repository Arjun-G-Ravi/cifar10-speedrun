# cifar10-speedrun
This repository is a my attempt at cifar10 speedrun challenge.

### Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images in 10 classes (such as airplane, car, bird, cat, etc.), with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used to test algorithms for image classification.

### Challenge
The goal is to reduce the training time of a model to get the accuracy of 94% and 96% on the CIFAR-10 dataset in a A100 GPU.
